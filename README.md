# Finger in Camera Speaks Everything: Unconstrained Air-Writing for Real-World
![intro-tcsvt_00](https://github.com/wmeiqi/AWCV/assets/35912099/d07661a6-cf7d-4312-adcf-89aae7c8f676)
Air-writing is a challenging task that combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, offering an intuitive and natural approach for human-computer interaction. However, current air-writing solutions face two primary challenges: (1) their dependency on complex sensors ($e.g.$, Radar, EEGs and others) for capturing precise handwritten trajectories, and (2) the absence of a video-based air-writing dataset that covers a comprehensive vocabulary range. These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world scenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops. To tackle these challenges, we present the groundbreaking air-writing Chinese character video dataset (AWCV-100K), serving as a pioneering benchmark for video-based air-writing. This dataset captures handwritten trajectories in various real-world scenarios using commonly accessible RGB cameras, eliminating the need for complex sensors. AWCV-100K includes 8.8 million video frames, encompassing the complete set of 3,755 characters from the GB2312-80 level-1 set (GB1). Furthermore, we introduce our baseline approach, the video-based character recognizer (VCRec). VCRec adeptly extracts fingertip features from sparse visual cues and employs a spatio-temporal sequence module for analysis. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of VCRec compared to existing models in recognizing air-written characters, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced human-computer interaction in real-world contexts. Moreover, our approach leverages affordable RGB cameras, enabling its applicability in a diverse range of scenarios.
